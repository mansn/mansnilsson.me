This post is a way for me to reflect on the last decade, but also to share highlights from it ðŸ™‚. The scope of this post is mostly about my journey transitioning between various roles.

## 2009

I finished my vocational education as a Software Tester in 2009, and landed my first job as a QA Engineer at a Live Streaming/Video On-demand company called MPS Broadband (nowadays called LiveArena AB).

I stayed ~5 years at this job, I learned and matured a lot throughout these years. I was lucky to end up in a company where you got involved in many parts of software development such as gathering requirements, design, development, build & deploy and collaborating with third party vendors.

## 2014

At this point, I'd started studying JavaScript in my free time. I've got good memories from the site CodeSchool.com, which later was aquired by Pluralsight in 2015.

I joined the consultant company [Konsultbolag1](https://konsultbolag1.se) that offers consultants specializing in QA (test automation, manual testing etc) and Requirements Specialists (Product Owners/Managers etc).

My first consultant assignment was at LÃ¤nsfÃ¶rsÃ¤kringar Bank, and I mostly did manual testing there (with a lot of other manual testers).
The culture with all other testers was great, but after 1 year I really felt that I wasn't getting any personal growth. I basically wanted to be coding on a daily basis.

## 2015

I took a break from working as a consultant, and started out as a QA Lead in a small company which went bankrupt 6 months after I started, which was an interesting experience in itself ðŸ˜….

At the end of this year, me and my partner's daughter was born ðŸ‘¶.

## 2016

I joined the consultant company **ADDQ**, which was a bit similar to my previous consultant company, i.e. focusing on QA & Requirements Specialists.
I started my first (and only) assignment at [Ving](https://www.ving.se/) (or Thomas Cook Northern Europe, nowadays known as Nordic Leisure Travel Group).

At this assignment I was expected do test automation (JavaScript/NodeJS), as well as manual testing.
I was really happy here, and I was lucky to stay as a consultant here for 3 years.

I feel that I got a lot of trust from my team and manager at Ving. I was able to tailor my own role as long as our team delivered what was expected.
I focused a lot on test automation here, as well as collaborating with developers.

This is where I met [Stefan FranzÃ©n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanfranzen), and he's my boss today ðŸ™‚.

## 2019

At this point, I felt that I was ready to try and get a developer role, or something in that direction. I left ADDQ and joined the consultant company (Diabol)[https://www.diabol.se/] which only hired developers and DevOps engineers.
[Stefan FranzÃ©n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanfranzen) recommended me to join Diabol, which I'm so grateful for. To me, this was the first real step towards my career as a developer.

Throughout the years, I'd been also studying JavaScript (and web development in general) on my free time.
