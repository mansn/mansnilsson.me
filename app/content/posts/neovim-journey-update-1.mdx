It's been almost 3 months since I wrote my previous post about switching to Neovim. At work I've been using a mix of VSCode and Neovim, because I feel a bit slower using Neovim.. I'm still getting acquainted with the vim motions and the overall workflow. I'm used to type somewhat fast (100+ WPM), so making this kind of switch is a bit painful =). I've also found myself missing features that I have in VSCode, but it's mainly a matter of finding the plugin I'm missing.

If you want to have a look at my Neovim setup, then you can check it out here: https://github.com/mansn/kickstart.nvim

Apart from using Neovim, I'm using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) since I'm used to having multiple panes, such has having a separate terminal or two files open side-by-side.
