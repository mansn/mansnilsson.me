  title: 'Considering switching to Neovim'
---

I've been using the https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim emulator for VSCode for probably 1 year now, and I've found it pretty fun!
A big inspiration of this is [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen).

That said, it's hard to "un-learn" existing muscle memory of e.g. using arrow keys to navigate around.
I still often jump around between words using option + arrow key, and I often end up moving the cursor with the arrow keys. 
I feel like staying in VSCode also limits me from forcing me to actually use the motions, because I still have to use the mouse a lot to do different things (maybe those actions can be handled without the mouse though).
So, I'm considering to switch to neovim on my private computer to force myself more into it. I've actually already installed neovim and started been through the "Tutor" (`:Tutor` command).. 

Why am I doing this? Mainly because I think it's fun. For some reason I keep thinking about it, and I like the idea of not needing to use the mouse as much do stuff. I also feel like there's a lot of interesting automation that could be done using Vim/Neovim. So I want to give that an honest shot. 
Maybe I'll regret this and go back in a year or something, but I think it'll be a fun learning experience =).
