  title: "Happy New Year 2026!"

Another year has passed, and it really felt like this year went by really quickly. I've switched jobs, and started consulting (again). This time I'm consulting as a fullstack developer, whereas my previous consulting experience has been as a QA Engineer/SDET (test automation, technical testing, manual testing, enabling developers etc etc).

I bought Kent C. Dodds' [Epic AI course](https://www.epicai.pro/) as I think the MCP Protocol is quite interesting, and I like Kent's content. I've bought other courses from him before (Testing JavaScript and Epic React), and I've been very happy with those courses. That said, I haven't finished all content in the those courses (most of the content in Testing JavaScript though).

The reason I bought the Epic AI course is because it seems that the major players are invested in the MCP Protocol (e.g. Microsoft, Anthropic). So, I think it's both smart and interesting to follow the ride, and hopefully even contribute to it. I remember when the [WebDriver protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)#Selenium_WebDriver) gradually got adopted for browser automation over the years, and became a web standard, and how browser vendors adopted it over time. As I'm writitng this I've learned that there's a new [WebDriver BiDi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oXic6dcn9w) protocol being worked on (since at least 2 years back, crazy). I'm suspecting that we're going to see something similar for the MCP Protocol as well. 

Looking forward to what this year's going to bring. Using an AI assistant as an extra tool for faster development is definitely here to stay, but it's definitely not replacing the need of developers, and it's definitely still as important to know your craft as a developer. Keep on learning, stay curious and build great things!

I'm still on my Neovim journey, and I'm using this [Copilot plugin](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua). I'm only using it for the ghost text/autocomplete though. When I do any chat/agentic mode stuff, then I still resort to Copilot in VSCode. I've tried [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/) a little bit, and I think I'll try that again to try and keep to only one editor.
